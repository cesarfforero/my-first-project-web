# Project 1 – Practice Web Page

This is my first practice project in web development. The goal is to start from the basics (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and build a solid foundation for more advanced projects in the future.

- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- Node.js + NPM  
- Live Server (for automatic browser reload on file changes)

## 📝 Log 2 - HTML Structure and Images Setup (2025-09-17)

Today I created the basic **HTML structure** for the project:

- Added the main semantic tags: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<section>`.
- Implemented a simple navigation bar (`<nav>`) with links inside a list (`<ul>` and `<li>`).
- Added the project logo inside the header using the `<img>` tag.
- Created the **hero section** inside `<main>` with:
  - A subtitle (`<p>`).
  - A main title (`<h1>` with a `<span>` for emphasis).
  - A description paragraph (`<p>`).
  - An image representing security (`<img>`).

I also created the **Styles** folder to organize and store the images (`HEN-Logo.png` and `img1.png`) that are used in the page.

This gives us the first version of the **skeleton of the webpage**, ready to be styled with CSS in the next steps.
